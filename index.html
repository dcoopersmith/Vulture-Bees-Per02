            <h1>Vulture Bees</h1>

            <h2>The Great Vulture Bee!</h2>

            <p><a target="_blank"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_bee"     >Vulture bees</a>, also called carrion bees, live in South America. These bees do not sting. They are in the genus Trigona. They feed on rotting meat.</p>

            <p> Vulture bees are colored reddish-brown. They have very powerful jaws, also called mandibles. They use their mandibles to tear off meat. Research has shownn that vulture bees prey on up 75 different kinds of animals.</p>

            <p>Vulture bees enter dead prey through the eyes. Then they eat the rotting flesh. Vulture bees vomit the flesh they eat into a storage pot. Later on worker bees will process it more.

            
                
                
                They have a whitish-gray fur coat spotted with large black spots that allows them to blend in with the rocky mountains where they live. Snow leopards have also adapted to live in some of <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/snow-leopard">the most severe climates on Earth</a>. You would think that they would be tough survivors, but you would be wrong.</p>

            <h2>How the Snow Leopard Adapts to its Environment</h2>

            <p>For thousands of years, these large cats have been the kings of the mountains of Central Asia. They can jump six times the length of their body and can use their large tails for balance. They can also wrap their tails around their body for an extra fur coat when it is extremely cold. So why are they endangered?</p>
